# clevername-react
## A React based journalling app

_________________________

*Ever wanted to know what you did a year ago? Two years ago?*

*Who were you and who will you become?*

Built in 2020, an eventful year for the whole world, this is a journal application intended to help you build self-reflective practice around who you've been, what you've done, and who you'd like to see yourself become. With a sentence or two each day, or even just a word, you can effectively save a piece of each day of the year, like mini time-capsules for your future self to learn from.

*What do you want to remember about today?*

This project started unofficially on December 6th, 2012, when I made my first journal entry in a physical copy of a sentence-a-day journal. Little did I know that years later, in 2017 I'd be so attached to the process that I would become detirmined to digitize it. Finally, in 2018 I made a version in Google Sheets, and I called it "Clever Name" because my partner suggested I "give it a clever name". I created a [template of that project here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LD71BD6aUxX25YVJqcQh-Q-cku1yHdZt9FS68_XO_dw/edit?usp=sharing).

In March 2020 I started courses in a fullstack bootcamp through [Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/). In June I started to build a [React Native](https://github.com/laylar/clevername-react-native) app but decided to change tactics and focus on a more universally accessible React app, which I mocked up with Pencil Project, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uzEYudYV_hYKOfp3XdAIQV_Ssyk13L3g/view?usp=sharing)! There's a server to go with it, [here](https://github.com/laylar/souvien-server), and I put them [together in a Github Project here](https://github.com/users/laylar/projects/1)!

I've since settled on the name *"Souvien"*, because as a linguaphile, I adore playing with words. It's not exactly a conjugation of "souvenir", which means "to remember" in French, but it's close.
